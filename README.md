TeXpert
=======

LaTeX document preparation app for Android

This app aims to be a TeX document development environment application like 
TeXMaker or TeXworks on PC.

The target of TeXpert is for _tablets_ like Nexus 7:

 * lack physical keyboard
 * screen is reasonably big for document editing
 * modern Android (4.2+)
 
Phone is not supported. I expect the following key features:

1. efficient input: _complementing_, not replacing, useful existing tools like _SwiftKey_;
1. smart correction suggestion;
1. button to compile with TeXPortal; and
1. syntax highlighting.
 
These features are ordered based on perceived importance.

Unlike their PC counterparts where one can easily type in the content.
The unavailability of physical keyboard makes it substantially more 
laborious to write on Nexus 7. Many text editor tends to treat LaTeX editing 
as a special case of code editing. This is a prevalent viewpoint on PC. 
Yet I believe that they are fairly different.
