TeXpert
=======

TeX document preparation Android app

This app aims to be a TeX document development environment application like TeXMaker or TeXworks on PC.

The target of TeXpert is for tablets like Nexus 7:

 *  lack physical keyboard
 
 *  screen is reasonably wide for editing
 
 *  modern Android 4.2+
 
Phone is not supported. The key features I expect are:

 1.  Efficient input, complement (not replace) SwiftKey
 
 2.  One-button to compile with TeXPortal
 
 3.  Smart correction

(The list is ranked in order of importance.)

Unlike their PC counterparts where one can easily type in the content. The unavailability of physical keyboard makes it substantially difficult to write on Nexus 7. Many text editor tends to treat LaTeX editing as a special case of code editing as this is prevalent in PC. However, I believe that they are very different.
